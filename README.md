# Project Name

This project was my personal attempt at creating a more efficient back-end system. At the time of inheriting the legacy code base, base line traffic metrics were at roughly 500 requests per second. Through much testing, I have effectively scaled the back-end system to handle a 400% increase in traffic at roughly 100ms to a single endpoint, given restrictions and other various constraints.
